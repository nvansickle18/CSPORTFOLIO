  <h3>Welcome to Noah's Computer Science Portfolio Website!</h3>
  <p>These are many of the projects that I have created during the past few years as a computer science student. Computer Science has been a huge part of my life for the past couple of years due to the ever increasing interest I have in the field! This website gives you the access to my contact information, Projects currently under development or already deployed, as well as a blog that I will be keeping in regards to the project I am currently working on. This WIP is for my 20% project in my Avanced Topics: Computer Science class at Kent Denver High School! Follow me on Twitter and Instagram if you enjoy!</p>
