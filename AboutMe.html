  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p> My name is Noah VanSickle, and I love computer science. I have been doing computer science seriously since 2015, or sophmore year of Highschool. But, I have been tinkering with code long before that, probably starting around age 11 or twelve. Computer science is one part of my very busy life schedule. I am apart of the School's football team, and I have been the Captain of the baseball team for the past two years. I am going on to play collegiate baseball at Union College in Schenectady New York! Many beleive that a person can only be a sports player, or a computer scientist, but I beleive both can be acheived simultaneously, if your mind is right. I love playing baseball and writing code, and it's something that I beleive makes me unique! Feel free to follow me on my twitter for some funny stuff!
